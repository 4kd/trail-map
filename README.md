Trail map
=========

> How do I learn Ruby on Rails? Vim? Test-Driven Development?

A few problems make those questions difficult to answer. We:

* have different levels of experience
* have different learning styles
* change our goals mid-process

A good metaphor for the learning process is
a trail map
for hiking, biking, or skiing. We:

* start in different places
* want to go to different places
* change direction mid-journey
