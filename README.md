> How do I learn Ruby on Rails? Vim? Test-Driven Development?

We run a program, [apprentice.io](http://apprentice.io), that has forced us to formalize our answers to such questions.

A few problems make those questions difficult to answer:

* Apprentices have different levels of experience.
* Apprentices have different learning styles.
* Apprentices' goals change mid-process.

Hiking, biking, or skiing trails are a good metaphor for the learning process: people start in different places, want to go to different places, and change direction mid-journey.
